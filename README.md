# Basic setup of a React project with TypeScript

This is intended to have basic packages to get you started in ANZx React projects.

## Install
```
yarn
```

## Develop
```
yarn dev
```

## Notes
`webpack-dev-server`, `eslint-webpack-plugin` doesn't play well with latest Webpack 5. Use Webpack 4, `eslint-loader` for now.

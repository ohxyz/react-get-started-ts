# Basic setup of a React project with TypeScript

For JavaScript version, refer to https://github.com/ohxyz/react-get-started

## Install
```
npm i
```

## Develop
```
npm run dev
```

## Notes
`webpack-dev-server`, `eslint-webpack-plugin` doesn't play well with latest Webpack 5. Use Webpack 4, `eslint-loader` for now.
